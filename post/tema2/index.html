The methodology reduces the time for launching updates to several days (in some cases, weeks). Thanks to this, developers get the opportunity to test innovations faster and implement solutions faster than competitors.</h2>
<h2 id="the-ability-to-check-options-operational-testing-and-many-iterations-help-the-developer-to-quickly-identify-options-that-have-no-prospects-even-at-the-initial-stages">The ability to check options.

For the first time the idea of its implementation was announced in 2006, and already in 2008, experts expressed the opinion that its popularity is associated with the development of cloud services. At the same time, the desire to use it to solve other tasks is not due to popularity, but to the advantages of the system — the ability to quickly coordinate and implement updates based on user experience.</h2>

CI/CD is suitable for tasks related to web development, omnichannel solutions, e-commerce and other complex frontend and middleware components. However, the introduction of Continuous integration &amp; Continuous delivery is not always justified — for example, in areas with rare software updates, the methodology will not justify itself.</h2>

The longer it is planned to develop and maintain a project, the more useful it will be to have a well-designed CI/CD. All the resources and costs of this tool pay off at a distance. With its help, time-to-market is indisputably reduced, and the probability of making a mistake is also reduced. The most important thing is to keep the instrument in good condition.</h2>
