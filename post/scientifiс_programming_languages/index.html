The meaning of the emergence of such a language - equipped with a set of computational formulas of additional information, turns this set into an algorithm. Programming language - a formal sign system designed to record computer programs. A programming language defines a set of lexical, syntactic and semantic rules that define the appearance of the program and the actions that the executor (computer) will perform under its control.</h2>

An assembler language uses symbolic notation of commands that are easy to understand and quick to remember. Instead of binary command sequences, symbolic designations are written as instructions and instead of binary addresses of data used in execution of instructions, symbolic names of this data are written as chosen by the programmer. Assembler language is sometimes called mnemocode or autocode.</h2>

Like a normal human language, such a language has its own alphabet - a set of symbols used in the language. From these characters are compiled what are called keywords of the language. Each of the keywords performs a different function, just as in a language we are accustomed to, words composed of the letters of the alphabet of a given language can perform the functions of different parts of speech. Keywords are linked together into sentences according to certain syntactic rules of the language. Each sentence defines a certain sequence of actions to be performed by a computer.</h2>

It makes programming easier than programming in machine codes. The programmer does not have to use the real addresses of the memory cells with the data in them, involved in the operation, and the calculated results, as well as the addresses of the commands that the program does not address.

Professor J. Samman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology noted that the mathematical clarity and ultimate clarity of Lisp is not all.

Over time, as other dialects began to appear, this &ldquo;original&rdquo; dialect became known as Dartmouth BASIC. The language was based partly on Fortran II and partly on Algol-60, with additions making it suitable for time-sharing and, later, text processing and matrix arithmetic. Basics was originally implemented on the GE-265 mainframe with support for multiple terminals. Contrary to popular belief, it was a compiled language at its inception. Basic was designed so that students could write programs using time-sharing terminals. It was created as a solution to problems with the complexity of older languages. It was intended for more &ldquo;simple&rdquo; users, not so much interested in the speed of programs, but simply in being able to use the computer to do their jobs.</h2>

It was created by Niklaus Wirth in 1968/9 (published in 1970), after his participation in the Algol-68 standard development committee. Pascal was created as a language for teaching procedural programming. The language was named after Blaise Pascal, the prominent 17th century French mathematician, physicist, literary writer, and philosopher, inventor of the world&rsquo;s first arithmetic machine.

The language was originally called Oak (&ldquo;oak&rdquo;) and was developed by James Gosling for programming consumer electronic devices.
